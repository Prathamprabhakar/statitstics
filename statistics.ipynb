        "1. What is statistics, and why is it important?\n",
        "Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It is important for making informed decisions in fields such as business, healthcare, economics, and social sciences.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the two main types of statistics?\n",

        "3. What are descriptive statistics?\n",
        "They summarize and describe the features of a dataset (e.g., mean, median, mode, variance).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is inferential statistics?\n",
        "It involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data.\n",
        "\n",

        "5. What is sampling in statistics?\n",
        "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole group.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. What are the different types of sampling methods?\n",
        "Simple random, stratified, systematic, cluster, and convenience sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between random and non-random sampling?\n",
        "Random sampling gives all members an equal chance of selection; non-random does not and may introduce bias.\n",
